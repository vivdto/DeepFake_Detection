## Explanation of the Project

We have developed a DeepFake Detection system using advanced deep-learning techniques, including ResNext and LSTM. The integration of the trained model with the Frontend UI is achieved through ReactJs, while Flask serves as the Backend. It's purpose is to predict the authenticity of videos and photos discerning between FAKE and REAL, providing users with a confidence ratio.
